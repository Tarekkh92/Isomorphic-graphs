Recognizing isomorphic graphs

Given: Let G1-(V1, E1) and G2-(V2, E2) be two graphs. Required: We say that two graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) are isomorphic if there is a 1-1 mapping, F: V1 â†’ V2 such that {v, w} is an edge in E1 if and only if {f(v), f(w)} is an edge in E2. We call such a mapping an isomorphism. Recognizing if these two graphs are isomorphic is a problem in NP in the general case and it is unknown if the problem is in NPC. Find if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
